					<p class="lead">My name is Iris Loret, and I was born in 2003, I'm currently studying Applied Computer Science at Thomas More in Geel.</p>
					<p class="lead"> I chose for this English program 
						because it was a new challenge and also an interesting experience where I improved my English a lot. At first, I wasn't sure what I wanted to study, but I'm 
						glad that I chose this program because I learned so many new things, and it is interesting. It also taught me that if you want something, you can do it.
						
						</p>
						<p class="lead"> 
						I love creative hobbies like making things with clay or epoxy but also running because it really clears my mind. I also like traveling, discovering new places
						and learning about other cultures.

						<h3>Deep Learning Model Analysis and Visualization</h3>
						<p>
							During my internship at LaBri for the Universit√© de Bordeaux, I worked on a deep learning model analysis and visualization project. 
							The main goal was to gain insights into the hidden layers of an AI Deep Learning model and to make it easy to visually see what happens 
							in those layers. It will also help to improve understanding and performance. In the visualization, you can see all the layers of a model 
							alongside their activations (outputs of a layer) grouped into clusters. It is interesting to see in what layer a model makes the correct 
							prediction and when it goes wrong because this can help developers identify which layers need improvement.

			<h3>Business Intelligence</h3>
			<p>For the BI course we created a dashboard and a data journalism website around Airbnb data. This assignment was individual.
			 We got data about 3 Belgian cities and were free to add our own data to it or look for more cities for example. What I did is add data about the dates.
			 So, I added if a specific date is a public holiday or part of a long weekend. For the dashboard I created several sheets with interesting visualisations.
			 You can take a look at them when you click the first button. For the second part of this project, the data journalism, I created a website that displays the 
			 visualisations with some additional explanation. You can find screenshots of the website when you click on the second button.
			</p>
			<p>From this project I learned how to think critically about what data would be interesting for a specific target audience. I had to first think about 
				what target audience I wanted to target and then what they would like to learn more about. I chose the target audience of the hosts. I liked thinking about
				what would be interesting for them and how to visualize it in a clear way.

			<h3>Data Visualization</h3>
			<div class="d-lg-flex">
			<div class="col-lg-6 pl-0">
			<p>For the Data Visualisation course we got football data and had to make visualisations. This was an individual project. There were some requirements that had 
				to be met such as a minimum number of sheets and chart types. Part of the project was also that I needed to record a video in which I explained my project. 
				If you click the button, you can see the whole project and the visualisations I made explained in the video.
			</p>
			<p>I learned from this project that it is quite hard to come up with good ideas for visualisations. But I also learned that I do like creating visualisations, 
				and it was interesting to see the correlations between data.

			<h3>Project 4.0</h3>
			<p>This was a big group project for a real company. We had to find a solution for the problem that they were experiencing. They had too little electric chargers
				for the amount of electric vehicles the employees have. We were a team of 5 students. I took care of the AI part of the application and the documentation.
				For the AI part I made sure there was data coming in from a camera that checked if there was a car parked on a specific parking spot or not. This is an 
				indication whether there are chargers free or not. This data was used to show on a map which spot was free and which wasn't free. There was also a visualization 
				made with this data. The time of the rush hours. So, you could see that for example there were not that many free spots on a Monday morning at 9, so that 
				is a rush hour. I used a yolo model that I trained further myself as well and computer vision to check the pixels. If there are enough pixels and it 
				detects a car in the parking spot, it will say that it is occupied.
			</p>
			<p>I learned to work together with students that are in a different field within the Applied Computer Science program. There were students from application development 
				but also from cyber security. It was interesting because we all know other things and can make a whole project together. I also learned more about the 
				communication with a real client.

			<h3>PHP</h3>
			<p>We had a course called PHP in the first semester of the second year. In the second semester, we had a big project using PHP. This is a group project and our 
				team consists of five people. This project builds on the Requirement Analysis project since it is the same subject: the staff management system 
				for a family in England. They wanted an application where they can do many things, such as keeping track of absences, planning meals where the staff can 
				subscribe to, managing tasks and appointments, uploading invoices and files, etc. In the images, you can see the pages I made, and I also did some small styling 
				changes in the project. The "Edit profile" page is to edit your own profile, in the "Meal Plans" page, they can see the scheduled meals and add, edit or 
				delete meal plans. The "Submit invoice" page is of course for submitting invoices. Lastly, the "Declare absence" page is for declaring when you will be absent. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I learned how to talk with a client in a professional way, listen to what they want, and how to work in a group. Of course, I also learned more about 
				Laravel 9, which is used in this project.

			<h3>AI</h3>
			<p>For our AI course, we had 3 smaller individual projects. The first one was around general AI, the second one about Machine Learning and the last one about 
				Deep Learning. All three of these projects were showed in a streamlit app. You can find screenshots of those websites when you click the button. The first
				project was a program for solving a cryptarithmetic puzzle. An example of this is SEND + MORE = MONEY. For this I used the simpleai library. 
			 </p>
			 <p>The second project was about benchmarking two Machine Learning algorithms. I chose to use a dataset about estimation of obesity levels based on eating 
				habits, physical condition, smoker... The goal is to classify the level of obesity. I used Random Forest, AdaBoost and KNeighbors to compare. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For the last project that was about Deep Learning, more specific image classification, I chose to scrape images of marine life. The classes I chose were 
				dolphins, sea turtles, star fish, clown fish and jelly fish. I trained a CNN on that dataset but the result was not the best. 
			</p>
			<p>
				From these small projects, I learned the basics of AI and what is possible. I learned how to create and train models but also how to use streamlit.

			<div class="col-lg-6 pl-0">
			<p>For the Webdesign Advanced course, we had a group project in which we had to choose a theme to create a website around. We chose for the theme space. 
				We each had to create two pages and do the home page together. We used html, css, JavaScript and bootstrap for this project. I provided the link to the 
				home page, one to the first page I made and the last link is the second page I made individually.
				</p>
				<p>I learned from this project how to use bootstrap elements and how difficult it can be to come up with beautiful designs for web pages.</p>

			<h3>Requirement Analysis</h3>
			<p>During the project week for the Requirement Analysis course, our team of six people did the analysis of the requirements our client provided. We started by 
				reviewing the reports of the other students who had the same assignment during the first semester. Then we had a short meeting with the client to ask 
				questions. After that it was time to make the use case diagram (first picture) and a data model (second picture) with the team. Then we started the individual
				 work, namely we started working on the prototypes. This is what the application we are going to create should look like. I have attached the pictures of
				  some of the prototypes I made. We had a team meeting to discuss the look and functions of the prototypes to make them look similar, and we made a few 
				  agreements and changes. Once that was finished, we could start working on the document, where we listed all the functionalities from the use case diagram
				   with the data model view and the prototype.
				</p>
				<p>I learned how to talk with a client in a professional way, but also how to translate the customer's requirements into actual functionalities and prototypes.
